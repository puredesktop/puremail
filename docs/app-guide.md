# puremail app guide

Read and compose email with thread-linked tasks and follow-ups.

## Using the app

1. Connect a supported mail account through the host’s account settings.
2. Select a mailbox and thread to read messages; compose or reply when ready.
3. Use linked tasks and follow-ups to track work associated with a conversation. Sending and synchronization require a configured account and network access.

## Development requirements

This app runs within [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai). Its local `@purescience/platform-*` dependencies, desktop bridge, and shared shell come from the parent suite and are not included in this repository. Use the matching suite development environment to install and run it; installing this repository alone is not sufficient for a complete desktop application.

With the shared dependencies available, use the scripts in `package.json` from the app directory:

```sh
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

`dev` starts the development entry point; `build` prepares the app bundle. Tests and type checking require the same shared dependencies as the app. Host services such as file access and connected accounts must be provided by the suite.
